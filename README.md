## 💡 About This Project
The idea for GlowAI came from my interest in **personalized skincare** and the power of AI to simplify product choices. I wanted to create a platform where users could get **customized product suggestions** without feeling overwhelmed by endless options. GlowAI combines clean design, user-friendly navigation, and interactive AI features to make skincare shopping **fun, easy, and effective**.
